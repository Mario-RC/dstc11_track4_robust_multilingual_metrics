# Task 2: Robust Metrics

In this task, the goal for participants is to propose robust metrics for automatic evaluation of just English dialogues that exhibit previously mentioned properties (section 2) while being robust when dealing with back-translated/paraphrased English sentences. The expected performance must be on par with the correlations with human-annotations obtained over the original sentences. As robustness criteria proposed, back-translated/paraphrased sentences should have the same semantic meaning as the original sentence, but different wording.

Additionally, participants will have the opportunity of testing robustness over alternative machine translations that the organizers will provide. Finally, the influence on the metric will be also evaluated when providing the back-translated/paraphrased current turn sentences instead of the original ones, always along with their respective back-translated/paraphrased context.

During the test phase, hidden and manually curated back-translated test data will be provided to participants to evaluate their proposed metrics.
