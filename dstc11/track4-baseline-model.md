# Baseline model

The purpose of this project is to identify a baseline classifier for DSTC-11. The default choice is Deep AM-FM (Zhang et al, 2020) (used for DSTC-10 and previously).

This project will investigate more recent approaches, based on fine-tuned large language models. Zhang et al note that their approach may be limited due to domain specificity. On the other hand LLMs are trained from large corpora that in priciple are less domain-dependent. This is an empirical question.
